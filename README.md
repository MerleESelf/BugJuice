# Bug Juice 

Bug Juice is a task managment application created by me, Merle Self: FullStack Developer, that seeks to aid in workflow productivity for other developers, like myself. In choosing this project, I wanted to continue to grow my understanding of development within the framework of Next.js. I also wanted exspose myself to newer technoligies and libraries used for modern web development such as Formik and Yup for form creation, and validation, respectively; Utilizing Supabase for my hosted database, and leveraging SupabaseAuth to set up third party user authentication via GitHub; I also sought to create a simplistic yet appleaing UI/UX utilizing Daisy UI components; Tailwindcss class based styling was also leveraged to create a responsive design, enabling the user to use the app both on desktop, and in their browser on moble.
